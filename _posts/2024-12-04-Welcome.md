## Welcome to _your_ blog!

Hi Julia! Merry Christmas and welcome to your very own blog!

You're probably reading this in Flagstaff together with our wonderful extended Pima family. What a great adventure we're on, from Austin to Aspen and beyond--I'm very grateful for the friendship that I've been able to grow here and seeing it blossom and transform into what it is now has been so beautiful!

Ok, on to the blog. **First thing** to know is that this is not your blog yet! It's code sitting on my GitHub account. I'll show you how to create a GitHub account and "fork" this code into your own repository. Then it's all yours!

**Second**, I'm writing this from a website called [Prose.io](https://prose.io) which is a file editor that feels a bit more like a traditional editor. Once you have your GitHub account setup you can link it to Prose and never go to GitHub.com again, yay!

**Three**, this blog is built with Jekyll, which uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Markdown is a way to format text inline (instead of the graphical toolbox found in Word). It's easy, follow that link to learn more!

Images are easy too. Here's a puppy.

**Number four**, this gift uncludes unlimited tech support and a free design session to make this blog look exactly how you want! I'm talking colors, fonts, images, animations--you name it. 

I'm thankful for how you've shown so much care for my endevours and I want to nurture yours too, so here you go--Julia has a blog! I can't wait to read what you have to say.

Love,

Tommy
